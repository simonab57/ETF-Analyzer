## Overview of the Analysis: ETF Analyzer
Building a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà Library to analyze a FinTech ETF portfolio that consists of four stocks. First section of this notebook is to simply analyze a single asset stock in an ETF. Next, we will optimize data access with advanced SQL queries by selecting specific closing prices that were greater than 200.0, and as well as finding the top ten daily returns of a specific stock in the portfolio. After, we will then analyze the ETF portfolio to evaluate its performance in regards to its annualized returns and cumulative returns. Finally, we will display the results by creating an interactive line plot that visualized the ETF portfolio. Lastly, for the final step, we will then deploy this notebook as a website application using voilà.
